# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a time-based one-time password (TOTP) authenticator application. It allows users to add accounts by scanning QR codes and displays the generated TOTP codes for each account.

## Style and Design

The application will follow Material Design 3 principles, with a clean and modern user interface. It will feature a dark and light theme, custom fonts, and a consistent color scheme.

## Features

*   **Account Management:** Users can add new TOTP accounts by scanning QR codes.
*   **TOTP Generation:** The application generates and displays time-based one-time passwords for each account.
*   **QR Code Scanner:** A built-in QR code scanner is used to add new accounts.
*   **Theme Toggle:** Users can switch between light and dark themes.

## Current Plan

The immediate plan is to resolve any outstanding build errors and ensure the application is in a runnable state. After that, we will focus on improving the user interface and adding new features, such as the ability to manually add accounts and edit existing ones.
